## Debugging

To debug the template you should clone it and work locally on the template or a
project generated with it. Then use
the [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/) to test it locally:

```bash
# At ~
vue init ./vue-plugin-template testing-dir
```

Make sure to prefix the template name with `./` or another character to indicate
you're using a local template.

Sometimes it's **simpler** to work on the generated project and port back any
modifications to the template.

Templates are rendered with [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

You can find more help about creating templates on
the
[vue-cli README](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/#writing-custom-templates-from-scratch)


**Happy coding**!
